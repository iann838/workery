Contains 3 new features (1 potentially breaking).

---

#### `App.securitySchemes` <Badge text="new" type="tip" />
#### `App.security` <Badge text="new" type="tip" />
#### `Route.security` <Badge text="new" type="tip" />
- Now supports defining OpenAPI security schemes, allowing proper authentication definitions on schemas and interactive _Authorize_ feature on Swagger. See [Authentication](/guides/authentication.md).

#### Dependency Caching <Badge text="new" type="tip" /> <Badge text="breaking?" type="danger" />
- Dependency handler responses will now be cached and reused during parameter resolution for requests, allowing that the same dependency if declared multiple times will execute **once** per request, reducing complexity. Marked as **potentailly breaking** because the caching could be unwanted behaviour, to disable caching, set `useCache: false`.

#### Schema Exclusion for Browser Enforced Headers <Badge text="new" type="tip" />
- Some headers are ignored, or not sent by the browser due to security or protocol enforcement. These headers under normal circumstances should be excluded from the OpenAPI parameters schema, **this does not affect route implementations**. See [Basic Parameters](/guides/basic-params.md).
